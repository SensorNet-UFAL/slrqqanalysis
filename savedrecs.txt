Selcuk; Beyah, Raheem			A simple visualization and programming framework for wireless sensor networks: PROVIZ	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; Visualization; Programming; Simulation; PROVIZ		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified development needs for programming, visualization, and simulation tools. However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications. To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF 802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ's visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create an all-encompassing development and test environment.

Those systems are constantly evolving and scaling up, involving a wide range of integration among users, devices, utilities, public services and also policies. Modelling such complex dynamic systems' architectures has always been essential for the development and application of techniques/tools to support design and deployment of integration of new components, as well as for the analysis, verification, simulation and testing to ensure trustworthiness. This article reports on the definition and implementation of a scalable component-based architecture that supports a cooperative energy demand response (DR) system coordinating energy usage between neighbouring households. The proposed architecture, called refinement of Cyber-Physical Component Systems (rCPCS), which extends the refinement calculus for component and object system (rCOS) modelling method, is implemented using Eclipse Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT), i.e., Reo coordination language. With rCPCS implementation in Reo, we specify the communication, synchronisation and co-operation amongst the heterogeneous components of the system assuring, by design scalability and the interoperability, correctness of component cooperation.

J	Moonen, L; Yazdanshenas, AR				Moonen, Leon; Yazdanshenas, Amir Reza			Analyzing and visualizing information flow in heterogeneous component-based software systems	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Information flow analysis; Component-based software systems; Model reconstruction; Program comprehension; Software visualization	DEPENDENCE	Context: Component-based software engineering is aimed at managing the complexity of large-scale software development by composing systems from reusable parts. To understand or validate the behavior of such a system, one needs to understand the components involved in combination with understanding how they are configured and composed. This becomes increasingly difficult when components are implemented in various programming languages, and composition is specified in external artifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysis of such heterogeneous systems is lacking. Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualize information flow in a component based system at various levels of abstraction. These visualizations are designed to support the comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and software developers for, respectively, certification and evolution of safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static program slicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows through and across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of five abstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distraction and cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs. We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views that support both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios. Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach and the resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarize the results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via two rounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views. We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective information presentations, that resulted from the evaluation. Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and views are useful for understanding and validating heterogeneous component-based systems, and address information needs that could earlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discuss lessons learned and directions for future work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mayer, S; Verborgh, R; Kovatsch, M; Mattern, F				Mayer, Simon; Verborgh, Ruben; Kovatsch, Matthias; Mattern, Friedemann			Smart Configuration of Smart Environments	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Internet of Things; semantic technologies; service composition; smart factory; smart home; web of things	WEB SERVICE COMPOSITION	One of the central research challenges in the Internet of Things and Ubiquitous Computing domains is how users can be enabled to "program" their personal and industrial smart environments by combining services that are provided by devices around them. We present a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible applications of the presented system include the management of smart homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare domains. Note to Practitioners-Machine tooling times are an important factor especially when producing small batch sizes. Our approach holds the potential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime, based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It can even consider properties that influence the process indirectly ("nonfunctional"), such as the time or monetary cost of a process. We additionally implemented a system that makes these rather complex descriptions understandable for nonspecialists. In this paper, we describe use cases from the home automation and future manufacturing domains.

Standard design and development techniques often fail to effectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As a result, there is a strong need for new programing models and abstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are a promising solution. However, existing such approaches either do not accurately model transitory interactions between components - which are typical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees for real-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications. To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design technique based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of interacting components and, in contrast to approaches from the literature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactions between them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at the component-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delay in the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change in the environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis into DEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system's robustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralized safety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity and usefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of an intelligent crossroad system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Smart-cities provide some of the response for this problem, but the aims remain open and generic. Taking the case study of urban transports and urban driving, there are already projects that generate and analyse data, but the information is often only disclosed to the user. Exposing some sort of this information to a community may lead to a faster behavioural modification. The fundamental objective of this work is to use the information acquired to improve awareness and behaviours in these societies. From this perspective, information tools such as gamification, user and community awareness are discussed in relationship to urban transports applications. The aim is to generate improved habits in a society using non-intrusive methods as mandated by smart-city design.

As these systems need to strike a balance between dependability, open-endedness and adaptability, and operate in dynamic and opportunistic environments, their design and development is particularly challenging. We take an architecture-based approach to this problem and advocate the use of component-based abstractions and related machinery to engineer self-adaptive CPS. Our approach is structured around DEECo a component framework that introduces the concept of component ensembles to deal with the dynamicity of CPS at the middleware level. DEECo provides the architecture abstractions of autonomous components and component ensembles on top of which different adaptation techniques can be deployed. This makes DEECo a vehicle for seamless experiments with self adaptive systems where the physical distribution and mobility of nodes, and the limited data availability play an important role.

An Internet of Things (IoT) application can be composed of multiple sets of sensing/actuating ingredients and each ingredient can satisfy specific requirement of users by processing specific physical data collected from physical world or committing an action. However, users' requirements for functionalities of ingredients and overall goals of IoT applications are diverse and may change. The application diversity leads to a rise in complexity as well as the cost of developing and maintaining the system software of an IoT application. In this work, we aim to reduce the design complexity and development cost of IoT application software. To achieve this goal, we use the software architecture PMDA which was proposed in our previous work. Here, we present a component-based formal methodology, namely FMDA, to transform the components of PMDA into sets of software modules as sensing/actuating functionality required. At the same time, we propose a connection mechanism, namely FMCA, which can match and establish the interconnection between any two sensing/actuating ingredients as required. The behavior of FMDA and FMCA have been investigated. The evaluation results show that FMCA is more effective in reducing the cost if the requirements changing frequently or the failure probability of matching the required sensing/actuating ingredients is small.

Even with the rising interest in IoT among developers, there is no simple way for them to prototype and realize their ideas. As of today, developing an IoT project requires cross domain knowledge of hardware, embedded systems, communication protocols, and cloud and web technologies. We propose and implement the Zygote framework, a browser-based tool to lower the entry barrier and enable rapid prototyping and building of IoT projects. Zygote reduces the time and effort required to do so by providing a visual interface to configure, control and deploy an IoT application. It also exposes a REST API for programmatic control as well as a dashboard for quick data visualization. With its modular architecture, it supports the creation of custom plugins as required by the developer. The Zygote framework enables users to build IoT prototypes in minutes and with virtually zero lines of code	[Karki, Deepak; Kaliki, Aishwarya] PES Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Rustagi, Ram P.] PES Inst Technol, Bangalore, Karnataka, India	Karki, D (reprint author), PES Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

Software component frameworks do not provide an explicit way to represent or reason about these processes. Meanwhile, hybrid program models have been successful in proving critical properties of discrete-continuous systems. These programs deal with diverse aspects of a cyber-physical system such as controller decisions, component communication protocols, and mechanical dynamics, requiring several programs to address the variation. However, currently these aspects are often intertwined in mostly monolithic hybrid programs, which are difficult to understand, change, and organize. These issues can be addressed by component-based engineering, making hybrid modeling more practical. This paper lays the foundation for using architectural models to provide component-based benefits to developing hybrid programs. We build formal architectural abstractions of hybrid programs and formulas, enabling analysis of hybrid programs at the component level, reusing parts of hybrid programs, and automatic transformation from views into hybrid programs and formulas. Our approach is evaluated in the context of a robotic collision avoidance case study.

Furthermore, the industry is slowly transitioning towards sophisticated Building Information Modelling (BIM), which necessitates the integration of domain specific knowledge into the BIM authoring tools. The approach presented in this paper elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a designer to create building models within the rules of Modular Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance the design process and allow designers to automate some complex modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise. The development of rule-based BIM objects exploits the parametric modelling capabilities of BIM authoring tools in addition to visual programming tool to automate the modelling process. The research first explains development of rule based BIM objects which is extended to streamline the overall design process. The presented approach discusses the customization of BIM authoring tool for modelling a residential facility in MC using axial planning of structural elements. In the prototype system, the designer is guided by specific rules and constraints while providing sufficient options to develop variegated configuration. The integration of design rules of MC standards with BIM application will be influential to increase radical use of BIM for built environment especially in the prefabrication industry.

In this paper, we build upon the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, with the aim of delivering networked solutions that enable multi-node wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to connect to the Internet in a secure, simple and efficient way. We also describe the design and implementation of a smart-home management system. The system is composed of a lightweight tool with an intuitive user interface for commissioning of IP-enabled WSNs. The solution includes a visual programming interface with a common framework for discovering smart home services on the WSN, and a code analysis and translation engine to generate Python code. This engine analyses the application rules defined with the graphical user interface and translates them into distributed application scripts. The system also includes modules to plan the optimization of the deployment, and deploy and start the generated code. In this paper we present a prototype of the system, with the visual programming solution and code generation module.

Developing IoT Applications in the Fog: a Distributed Dataflow Approach	PROCEEDINGS 2015 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IOT)	OCT 26-28, 2015	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA			Distributed dataflow; Internet of Things; Programming models; Node-RED		In this paper we examine the development of IoT applications from the perspective of the Fog Computing paradigm, where computing infrastructure at the network edge in devices and gateways is leverage for efficiency and timeliness. Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT: heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.

PERCS proposes to achieve these outcomes by engaging building occupants as partners in a user-centered smart service platform. Using a non-intrusive load monitoring approach, PERCS uses a single sensing point in each home to capture smart electric meter data in real time. The household energy signal is disaggregated into individual load signatures of common appliances (e.g., air conditioners), yielding near real-time appliance-level energy information. Users interact with PERCS via a mobile phone platform that provides household-and appliance-level energy feedback, tailored recommendations, and a competitive game tied to energy use and behavioral changes. PERCS challenges traditional energy management approaches by directly engaging occupant as key elements in a technological system.

On the other hand a smart city with these requirements is usually evolving through incremental automation and integration of new components, that are digital or physical components or smart devices. To handle the growing scale and complexity of a system, an adaptive modelling method is needed for dynamic analysis and verification and/or validation, and integration. In this paper, we consider the case study of a Demand Response (DR) Programme that is to be realized by the deployment of a network of smart meters.

Standard design and development techniques from the embedded domain fail to accurately model the dynamics of such systems and, hence, there is an increasing need for new programming models and abstractions. Component-based design approaches are a promising solution to manage the complexity of large-scale dynamic systems. However, existing such approaches either do not accurately model transitory interactions between components which are typical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees for real-time behavior which is essential in many safety-critical applications. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we present a component-based design technique based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of interacting components. In contrast to other component-based design approaches from the literature, DEECo provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactions between components. We introduce necessary extensions to the DEECo design flow and integrate it with real-time analysis techniques that allow reasoning about timing behavior at the component-description level. Finally, we illustrate the simplicity and usefulness of our approach on a case study consisting of an intelligent crossroad system.

In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficiently delimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software-instead of updating the full binary image-is of vital importance. However, most existing approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to date due to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In this article, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtime reconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present an integrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. The middleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigating the cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via the notion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-based programming abstraction in order to facilitate the development of dynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWARE imposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and component reconfiguration and consumes approximately 6% of the total code memory on a TELOSB sensor platform.

The complexity, measurable through the huge solution space, as well as the time-consuming preparation of a decision in line with the limited amount of time of the final decision makers - CEOs and upper management. The experience from several industry projects showed the demand to transfer and apply the concept of gamification in a cyber-physical environment to decision-making in Global Footprint Design. Smart IT tools, which support the intuition and practical knowledge of the decision maker but do not finally make the decision for them, are needed. Based on general criteria for successful gamified IT tools three specific requirements for judging global production networks are derived: value creation, ludic goal orientation and autonomous discovery. The major challenges and these specified principles of gamification are addressed within the scope of an IT tool which simplifies and improves complex global footprint decisions by employing elements of gamification. It is analysed to which degree the criteria are already fulfilled, which benefits this prototype of a gamified IT tool can offer and what future research has to be conducted in order to fully let CEOs game their global footprint strategy.

Objects in the IoT have identities, attributes and personalities in the virtual world. These objects are integrated together using intelligent interfaces. The IoT has a lot of challenges and issues that require further research before achieving a global scale. This paper presents a generic IoT architecture to modularize physical objects into the digital world. It demonstrates that the future IoT can be designed based on component-based communication and existing communication standards. To achieve integration both on a device and semantic level, physical objects and services can be virtualised as instantiated middleware components. By building ontologies, third-parties can also customize objects and services.

The SCA standard promotes the use of components and architecture descriptors, and mostly covers the lifecycle steps of implementation and deployment. Unfortunately, SCA does not address the governance of SCA applications and provides no support for the maintenance of deployed components. This article covers this issue and introduces the FRASCATI platform, a run-time support for SCA with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities and run-time management features. This article presents the internal component-based architecture of the FRASCATI platform, and highlights its key features. The component-based design of the FRASCATI platform introduces many degrees of flexibility and configurability in the platform itself and it can host the SOA applications. This article reports on micro-benchmarks highlighting that run-time manageability in the FRASCATI platform does not decrease its performance when compared with the de facto reference SCA implementation: Apache TUSCANY. Finally, a smart home scenario illustrates the extension capabilities and the various reconfigurations of the FRASCATI platform. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Describing the behavior of the data with a model, and then looking at the parameters of the model, or detecting differences between the model and the real data, is how experimental data is typically used in other fields. The work presented here aims at facilitating the use of sensor data models to describe the expected behavior of the sensor observations. The processing of such models can be pushed into the wireless sensor network to eliminate redundant information as early in the data collection chain as possible, thus minimizing both bandwidth requirements and energy consumption.

The feature-richness and the layers of functionality, however, tend to be excessive and a source of performance overhead for Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). Yet it is necessary to leverage the decades of proven patterns and principles in these infrastructures. This paper presents an approach to systematically specialize general-purpose middleware used to host CPS. Our approach is based on the principles of Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD), which requires deducing an algebraic structure of contemporary middleware based on a higher level of abstraction of features. The paper showcase how Origami matrices and generative programming can play a key role in realizing the specializations. The paper concludes by delving in to future open areas of middleware specialization research.

Synthesizing component-based WSN applications via automatic combination of code optimization techniques	USIC 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON QUALITY SOFTWARE			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Quality Software	OCT 11-12, 2007	Portland, OR	Univ Hong Kong		wireless sensor network; adaptive software design; resource constraint; code optimization technique	DESIGN; SOFTWARE	Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications sense events in-situ and compute results in-network. Their software components should run on platforms with stringent constraints on node resources. Developers often design their programs by trial-and-error with a view to meeting these constraints. Through numerous iterations, they manually measure and estimate how far the programs cannot fulfill the requirements, and make adjustments accordingly. Such manual process is time-consuming and error-prone. Automated support is necessary. Based on an existing task view that treats a WSN application as tasks and models resources as constraints, we propose a new component view that associates components with code optimization techniques and constraints. We develop algorithms to synthesize components running on nodes, fulfilling the constraints, and thus optimizing their quality. We evaluate our proposal by a simulation study adapted from a real-life WSN application.	[Zhang, Zhenyu; Tse, T. H.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chan, W.

S	Bakshi, A; Prasanna, VK		Pal, A; Kshemkalyani, AD; Kumar, R; Gupta, A		Bakshi, A; Prasanna, VK			Programming paradigms for networked sensing: A distributed systems' perspective	DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING - IWDC 2005, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Workshop on Distributed Computing (IWDC 2005)	DEC 27-30, 2005	Kharagpur, INDIA					Research in embedded networked sensing has primarily focused on the design of hardware architectures for sensor nodes and infrastructure protocols for long lived operation of resource constrained sensor network deployments. There is now an increasing interest in the programming aspects of sensor networks, especially in the broader context of pervasive computing. This paper provides a brief overview of ongoing research in programming of sensor networks and classifies it into layers of abstraction that provide the application developer with progressively higher level primitives to express distributed, phenomenon-centric collaborative computation, As a specific instance of a macroprogramming methodology, we discuss the data driven Abstract Task Graph (ATaG) model and the structure of its underlying runtime system. ATaG separates the application functionality from non-functional aspects, thereby enabling end-to-end architecture-independent programming and automatic software synthesis for a class of networked sensor systems. A prototype visual programming, software synthesis, functional simulation and visualization environment for ATaG has been implemented.

J	Jahnke, JH; d'Entremont, M; Stier, J				Jahnke, JH; d'Entremont, M; Stier, J			Facilitating the programming of the smart home	IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								The ongoing miniaturization and cost reduction in the sector of electronic hardware has created ample opportunity for equipping private households with inexpensive smart devices for controlling and automating various tasks in our daily lives. Networking technology and standards have an important role in driving this development. The omnipresence of the Internet via phone lines, TV cable, power lines, and wireless channels facilitates ubiquitous networks of smart devices that will significantly change the way we interact with home appliances. Home networking is foreseen to become one of the fastest growing markets in the area of information technology. However, interoperability and flexibility of embedded devices are key challenges for making smart home technology accessible to a broad audience. In particular, the software programs that determine the behavior of the smart home must facilitate customizability and extensibility. Unlike industrial applications, typically engineered by highly skilled programmers, control and automation programs for the smart home should be understandable by laypeople. In this article we discuss how recent technological progress in the areas of visual programming languages, component software, and connection-based programming can be applied to programming the smart home. As an example of an industrial prototype solution, we present microCommander, a visual tool for rapidly programming synergetic devices for the smart home.

B	Al-Muhtadi, J; Anand, M; Mickunas, MD; Campbell, R			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Al-Muhtadi, J; Anand, M; Mickunas, MD; Campbell, R			Secure Smart Homes using Jini and UIUCSESAME	16TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SECURITY APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC 00)	DEC 11-15, 2000	NEW ORLEANS, LA	Appl Comp Secur Associates, ACM SIGSAC			DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS	In this paper, we discuss our approach to constructing a dynamic and secure "Smart Home" environment and tackling the challenges associated with it We envision a Smart Home as an active environment populated with smart, dynamically configurable consumer devices capable of interacting with humans and other smart devices. In such a dynamic and active environment, there is a great need for an agile, lightweight, distributed security mechanism. This security mechanism needs to be programmable and able to evolve as rapidly as the environment itself Yet, this mechanism should be able to adapt to environments with scarce resources. We present Tiny SESAME to meet these challenges while utilizing Jini(TM) technology from Sun Microsystems to handle the common parts of distributed devices. Tiny SESAME is a lightweight, component-based, Java-implementation of a subset of SESAME. SESAME is an extension to Kerberos that supports public key technologies, access control, and delegation of access rights. We discuss our Tiny SESAME and how it could be integrated with handheld and consumer devices.
