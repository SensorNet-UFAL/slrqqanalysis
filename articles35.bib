Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in
   various critical domains like health care, critical infrastructure, and
   climate monitoring, where application builders have diversified
   development needs for programming, visualization, and simulation tools.
   However, these tools are designed as separate stand-alone applications.
   To avoid the complexity of using multiple tools, we have designed a new
   extensible, multi-platform, scalable, and open-source framework called
   PROVIZ. PROVIZ is an integrated visualization and programming framework
   with the following features: PROVIZ includes (1) a visualization tool
   that can visualize heterogeneous WSN traffic (with different packet
   payload formats) by parsing the data received either from a packet
   sniffer (e.g., a sensor-based sniffer or a commercial TI SmartRF
   802.15.4 packet sniffer) or from a simulator (e.g., OMNeT); (2) a
   scripting language based on the TinyOS sensor network platform that aims
   at reducing code size and improving programming efficacy; (3) an
   over-the-air programming tool to securely program sensor nodes; (4) a
   visual programming tool with basic sensor drag-and-drop modules for
   generating simple WSN programs; and (5) a visual network comparison tool
   that analyzes packet traces of two networks to generate a juxtaposed
   visual comparison of contrasting network characteristics. PROVIZ also
   includes built-in extensible visual demo deployment capabilities that
   allow users to quickly craft network scenarios and share them with other
   users. In this work, we introduce the various features of PROVIZ's
   visualization and programming framework, analyze test scenarios, and
   discuss how all the tools can be used in sync with each other to create
   an all-encompassing development and test environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Interoperability: A Case Study on Integrating Energy Demand Response
   Systems}},

Abstract = {{Smart city systems embrace major challenges associated with climate
   change, energy efficiency, mobility and future services by embedding the
   virtual space into a complex cyber-physical system. Those systems are
   constantly evolving and scaling up, involving a wide range of
   integration among users, devices, utilities, public services and also
   policies. Modelling such complex dynamic systems' architectures has
   always been essential for the development and application of
   techniques/tools to support design and deployment of integration of new
   components, as well as for the analysis, verification, simulation and
   testing to ensure trustworthiness. This article reports on the
   definition and implementation of a scalable component-based architecture
   that supports a cooperative energy demand response (DR) system
   coordinating energy usage between neighbouring households. The proposed
   architecture, called refinement of Cyber-Physical Component Systems
   (rCPCS), which extends the refinement calculus for component and object
   system (rCOS) modelling method, is implemented using Eclipse Extensible
   Coordination Tools (ECT), i.e., Reo coordination language. With rCPCS
   implementation in Reo, we specify the communication, synchronisation and
   co-operation amongst the heterogeneous components of the system
   assuring, by design scalability and the interoperability, correctness of
   component cooperation.}},

Title = {{Analyzing and visualizing information flow in heterogeneous
   component-based software systems}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{34-55}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: Component-based software engineering is aimed at managing the
   complexity of large-scale software development by composing systems from
   reusable parts. To understand or validate the behavior of such a system,
   one needs to understand the components involved in combination with
   understanding how they are configured and composed. This becomes
   increasingly difficult when components are implemented in various
   programming languages, and composition is specified in external
   artifacts. Moreover, tooling that supports in-depth system-wide analysis
   of such heterogeneous systems is lacking.
   Objective: This paper contributes a method to analyze and visualize
   information flow in a component based system at various levels of
   abstraction. These visualizations are designed to support the
   comprehension needs of both safety domain experts and software
   developers for, respectively, certification and evolution of
   safety-critical cyber-physical systems.
   Method: We build system-wide dependence graphs and use static program
   slicing to determine all possible end-to-end information flows through
   and across a system's components. We define a hierarchy of five
   abstractions over these information flows that reduce visual distraction
   and cognitive overload, while satisfying the users' information needs.
   We improve on our earlier work to provide interconnected views that
   support both systematic, as well as opportunistic navigation scenarios.
   Results: We discuss the design and implementation of our approach and
   the resulting views in a prototype tool called FlowTracker. We summarize
   the results of a qualitative evaluation study, carried out via two
   rounds of interview, on the effectiveness and usability of these views.
   We discuss a number of improvements, such as more selective information
   presentations, that resulted from the evaluation.
   Conclusion: The evaluation shows that the proposed approach and views
   are useful for understanding and validating heterogeneous
   component-based systems, and address information needs that could
   earlier only be met by manual inspection of the source code. We discuss
   lessons learned and directions for future work. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{One of the central research challenges in the Internet of Things and
   Ubiquitous Computing domains is how users can be enabled to
   ``program{''} their personal and industrial smart environments by
   combining services that are provided by devices around them. We present
   a service composition system that enables the goal-driven configuration
   of smart environments for end users by combining semantic metadata and
   reasoning with a visual modeling tool. In contrast to process-driven
   approaches where service mashups are statically defined, we make use of
   embedded semantic API descriptions to dynamically create mashups that
   fulfill the user's goal. The main advantage of our system is its high
   degree of flexibility, as service mashups can adapt to dynamic
   environments and are fault-tolerant with respect to individual services
   becoming unavailable. To support users in expressing their goals, we
   integrated a visual programming tool with our system that allows to
   model the desired state of a smart environment graphically, thereby
   hiding the technicalities of the underlying semantics. Possible
   applications of the presented system include the management of smart
   homes to increase individual well-being, and reconfigurations of smart
   environments, for instance in the industrial automation or healthcare
   domains.
   Note to Practitioners-Machine tooling times are an important factor
   especially when producing small batch sizes. Our approach holds the
   potential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime,
   based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It can
   even consider properties that influence the process indirectly
   ({''}nonfunctional{''}), such as the time or monetary cost of a process.
   We additionally implemented a system that makes these rather complex
   descriptions understandable for nonspecialists. In this paper, we
   describe use cases from the home automation and future manufacturing
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{The development of Internet of Things, fueled by cloud computing and big
   data processing from upper level, and by ubiquitous sensory and actuator
   devices from the lower level, has taken a sharp turn towards integrating
   the entire information, computing, communication, and control systems.
   This special issue selected seven papers from the 2015 IEEE twelfth
   International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ISADS).
   These papers cover the latest research on IoT and ADS based system
   science and system engineering methods; the wearable sensor network
   development and applications; and data analysis for security and
   reliability in IoT and ADS applications. As an addition to these
   selected topics, this guest editorial paper also adds IoT education and
   dissemination aspects to this special issue. As the IoT research and
   applications expand explosively into all the domains, schools and
   universities must prepare students to understand and to be able to
   program the IoT devices. This paper presents a visual programming
   environment that allows students without programming background to learn
   the key concepts of computing and IoT devices, and to program IoT
   devices into different application systems. (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems typically involve large numbers of mobile
   autonomous devices that closely interact with each other and their
   environment. Standard design and development techniques often fail to
   effectively manage the complexity and dynamics of such systems. As a
   result, there is a strong need for new programing models and
   abstractions. Towards this, component-based design methods are a
   promising solution. However, existing such approaches either do not
   accurately model transitory interactions between components - which are
   typical of cyber-physical systems - or do not provide guarantees for
   real-time behavior which is essential in safety-critical applications.
   To overcome this problem, we present a component-based design technique
   based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo
   framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of
   interacting components and, in contrast to approaches from the
   literature, it provides mechanisms to describe transitory interactions
   between them. To allow reasoning about timing behavior at the
   component-description level, we characterize DEECo's closed-loop delay
   in the worst case, i.e., the maximum time needed to react to a change in
   the environment. Based on this, we incorporate real-time analysis into
   DEECo's design flow. This further allows us to analyze the system's
   robustness under unreliable communication and to design decentralized
   safety-preserving mechanisms. To illustrate the simplicity and
   usefulness of our approach, we present a case study consisting of an
   intelligent crossroad system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An information centric society needs means to improve itself by taking
   advantage of the communication channels and knowledge it possesses.
   Smart-cities provide some of the response for this problem, but the aims
   remain open and generic. Taking the case study of urban transports and
   urban driving, there are already projects that generate and analyse
   data, but the information is often only disclosed to the user. Exposing
   some sort of this information to a community may lead to a faster
   behavioural modification. The fundamental objective of this work is to
   use the information acquired to improve awareness and behaviours in
   these societies. From this perspective, information tools such as
   gamification, user and community awareness are discussed in relationship
   to urban transports applications. The aim is to generate improved habits
   in a society using non-intrusive methods as mandated by smart-city
   design.}},

   paved the way for creating ubiquitous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
   grafted with self-configuring and self-adaptive capabilities. As these
   systems need to strike a balance between dependability, open-endedness

   their design and development is particularly challenging. We take an
   architecture-based approach to this problem and advocate the use of
   component-based abstractions and related machinery to engineer
   self-adaptive CPS. Our approach is structured around DEECo a component
   framework that introduces the concept of component ensembles to deal
   with the dynamicity of CPS at the middleware level. DEECo provides the
   architecture abstractions of autonomous components and component
   ensembles on top of which different adaptation techniques can be
   deployed. This makes DEECo a vehicle for seamless experiments with self
   adaptive systems where the physical distribution and mobility of nodes,
   and the limited data availability play an important role.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing/actuating ingredients are software running on smart devices
   which are widely deployed in physical spaces and integrated into our
   daily life. An Internet of Things (IoT) application can be composed of
   multiple sets of sensing/actuating ingredients and each ingredient can
   satisfy specific requirement of users by processing specific physical
   data collected from physical world or committing an action. However,
   users' requirements for functionalities of ingredients and overall goals
   of IoT applications are diverse and may change. The application
   diversity leads to a rise in complexity as well as the cost of
   developing and maintaining the system software of an IoT application. In
   this work, we aim to reduce the design complexity and development cost
   of IoT application software. To achieve this goal, we use the software
   architecture PMDA which was proposed in our previous work. Here, we
   present a component-based formal methodology, namely FMDA, to transform
   the components of PMDA into sets of software modules as
   sensing/actuating functionality required. At the same time, we propose a
   connection mechanism, namely FMCA, which can match and establish the
   interconnection between any two sensing/actuating ingredients as
   required. The behavior of FMDA and FMCA have been investigated. The
   evaluation results show that FMCA is more effective in reducing the cost
   if the requirements changing frequently or the failure probability of
   matching the required sensing/actuating ingredients is small.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT), which has had an unprecedented effect in
   the manufacturing industry, is now becoming increasingly popular in
   everyday life. Even with the rising interest in IoT among developers,
   there is no simple way for them to prototype and realize their ideas. As
   of today, developing an IoT project requires cross domain knowledge of
   hardware, embedded systems, communication protocols, and cloud and web
   technologies. We propose and implement the Zygote framework, a
   browser-based tool to lower the entry barrier and enable rapid
   prototyping and building of IoT projects. Zygote reduces the time and
   effort required to do so by providing a visual interface to configure,
   control and deploy an IoT application. It also exposes a REST API for
   programmatic control as well as a dashboard for quick data
   visualization. With its modular architecture, it supports the creation
   of custom plugins as required by the developer. The Zygote framework
   enables users to build IoT prototypes in minutes and with virtually zero
   lines of code}},

Abstract = {{Modern cyber-physical systems interact closely with continuous physical
   processes like kinematic movement. Software component frameworks do not
   provide an explicit way to represent or reason about these processes.
   Meanwhile, hybrid program models have been successful in proving
   critical properties of discrete-continuous systems. These programs deal
   with diverse aspects of a cyber-physical system such as controller
   decisions, component communication protocols, and mechanical dynamics,
   requiring several programs to address the variation. However, currently
   these aspects are often intertwined in mostly monolithic hybrid
   programs, which are difficult to understand, change, and organize. These
   issues can be addressed by component-based engineering, making hybrid
   modeling more practical. This paper lays the foundation for using
   architectural models to provide component-based benefits to developing
   hybrid programs. We build formal architectural abstractions of hybrid
   programs and formulas, enabling analysis of hybrid programs at the
   component level, reusing parts of hybrid programs, and automatic
   transformation from views into hybrid programs and formulas. Our
   approach is evaluated in the context of a robotic collision avoidance
   case study.}},

   designers of the complexities and heterogeneity of wireless sensory
   networks (WSNs), devices, communication media, protocols and operating

   been undertaken. The result is DSL-4-IoT Editor-Designer, which is based
   on high level visual programming language, established on the class of
   visual domain specific modeling languages (VDSMLs). DSL-4-IoT is using
   formal presentations and abstract syntax in a metamodel. The visual
   front-end of the Editor has been developed in JavaScript language. The
   runtime execution of generated IoT application configuration files is
   done by the open source project ``OpenHAB{''} runtime engine.
   In order to demonstrate the viability and usability of the developed
   DSL-4-IoT visual model based language, an experimental IoT testbed
   including 15 heterogeneous wireless sensory devices spanning two
   application domain (smart home and remote patient monitoring), has been

Abstract = {{The introduction of computing tools to Architecture, Engineering \&
   Construction (AEC) industry has enabled the professionals to navigate
   successfully from traditional design/drafting to Computer Aided
   Design/Drafting (CADD). Furthermore, the industry is slowly
   transitioning towards sophisticated Building Information Modelling
   (BIM), which necessitates the integration of domain specific knowledge
   into the BIM authoring tools. The approach presented in this paper
   elucidates the development of rule-based BIM objects which allows a
   designer to create building models within the rules of Modular
   Coordination (MC). With this development, a designer will be able to use
   MC standards to size and locate building objects in a modular reference
   frame. Integration of rules of MC with BIM authoring tool will enhance
   the design process and allow designers to automate some complex
   modelling/documentation activities requiring no design expertise. The
   development of rule-based BIM objects exploits the parametric modelling
   capabilities of BIM authoring tools in addition to visual programming
   tool to automate the modelling process. The research first explains
   development of rule based BIM objects which is extended to streamline
   the overall design process. The presented approach discusses the
   customization of BIM authoring tool for modelling a residential facility
   in MC using axial planning of structural elements. In the prototype
   system, the designer is guided by specific rules and constraints while
   providing sufficient options to develop variegated configuration. The
   integration of design rules of MC standards with BIM application will be
   influential to increase radical use of BIM for built environment
   especially in the prefabrication industry. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Most of the currently deployed integrated home management products
   require an experienced technician to install and configure the system.
   In this paper, we build upon the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, with
   the aim of delivering networked solutions that enable multi-node
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to connect to the Internet in a secure,
   simple and efficient way. We also describe the design and implementation
   of a smart-home management system. The system is composed of a
   lightweight tool with an intuitive user interface for commissioning of
   IP-enabled WSNs. The solution includes a visual programming interface
   with a common framework for discovering smart home services on the WSN,
   and a code analysis and translation engine to generate Python code. This
   engine analyses the application rules defined with the graphical user
   interface and translates them into distributed application scripts. The
   system also includes modules to plan the optimization of the deployment,
   and deploy and start the generated code. In this paper we present a
   prototype of the system, with the visual programming solution and code
   generation module.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine the development of IoT applications from the
   perspective of the Fog Computing paradigm, where computing
   infrastructure at the network edge in devices and gateways is leverage
   for efficiency and timeliness. Due to the intrinsic nature of the IoT:
   heterogeneous devices/resources, a tightly coupled perception-action
   cycle and widely distributed devices and processing, application
   development in the Fog can be challenging. To address these challenges,
   we propose a Distributed Dataflow (DDF) programming model for the IoT
   that utilises computing infrastructures across the Fog and the Cloud. We
   evaluate our proposal by implementing a DDF framework based on Node-RED
   (Distributed Node-RED or D-NR), a visual programming tool that uses a
   flow-based model for building IoT applications. Via demonstrations, we
   show that our approach eases the development process and can be used to
   build a variety of IoT applications that work efficiently in the Fog.}},

   to achieve these outcomes by engaging building occupants as partners in
   a user-centered smart service platform. Using a non-intrusive load
   monitoring approach, PERCS uses a single sensing point in each home to
   capture smart electric meter data in real time. The household energy
   signal is disaggregated into individual load signatures of common
   appliances (e.g., air conditioners), yielding near real-time
   appliance-level energy information. Users interact with PERCS via a
   mobile phone platform that provides household-and appliance-level energy
   feedback, tailored recommendations, and a competitive game tied to
   energy use and behavioral changes. PERCS challenges traditional energy
   management approaches by directly engaging occupant as key elements in a

Abstract = {{It is expected that the Internet of Things (IoT) provides the
   foundational infrastructure for smart cities, and making ICT an enabling
   technology to meet major challenges associated with climate change,
   energy efficiency, mobility and future services. On the other hand a
   smart city with these requirements is usually evolving through
   incremental automation and integration of new components, that are
   digital or physical components or smart devices. To handle the growing
   scale and complexity of a system, an adaptive modelling method is needed
   for dynamic analysis and verification and/or validation, and
   integration. In this paper, we consider the case study of a Demand
   Response (DR) Programme that is to be realized by the deployment of a
   network of smart meters. Through this case study, we propose a
   component-based modelling approach and demonstrate how it deals with the

Abstract = {{Cyber-physical systems typically involve a large number of mobile
   autonomous devices that closely interact with each other and their
   environment. Standard design and development techniques from the
   embedded domain fail to accurately model the dynamics of such systems
   and, hence, there is an increasing need for new programming models and
   abstractions. Component-based design approaches are a promising solution
   to manage the complexity of large-scale dynamic systems. However,
   existing such approaches either do not accurately model transitory
   interactions between components which are typical of cyber-physical
   systems - or do not provide guarantees for real-time behavior which is
   essential in many safety-critical applications. To overcome this
   problem, in this paper, we present a component-based design technique
   based on DEECo (Dependable Emergent Ensembles of Components). The DEECo
   framework allows modeling large-scale dynamic systems by a set of
   interacting components. In contrast to other component-based design
   approaches from the literature, DEECo provides mechanisms to describe
   transitory interactions between components. We introduce necessary
   extensions to the DEECo design flow and integrate it with real-time
   analysis techniques that allow reasoning about timing behavior at the
   component-description level. Finally, we illustrate the simplicity and
   usefulness of our approach on a case study consisting of an intelligent
   crossroad system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a practical framework to bring the cyber-physical
   block diagram models, such as Ptolemy, to the practice of industrial
   automation. Cyber-Physical Component (CPC) architecture is suggested.
   CPC aims at the improvement of design, verification and validation
   practices in automation of Smart Grid. IEC 61499 standard is used as a
   basis for this architecture. This architecture addresses several design
   software and system engineering challenges: right equilibrium between
   abstract representation and ``executability{''} and round-trip
   engineering. An CPC exhibit such properties as portability,
   interoperability and configurability thanks to the reliance on open
   standards. The use of time stamp based execution paradigm adds
   determinism and predictability at the run-time.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless reprogramming of sensor nodes is a critical requirement in
   long-lived wireless sensor networks (WSNs) addressing several concerns,
   such as fixing bugs, upgrading the operating system and applications,
   and adapting applications behavior according to the physical
   environment. In such resource-poor platforms, the ability to efficiently
   delimit and reconfigure the necessary portion of sensor software-instead
   of updating the full binary image-is of vital importance. However, most
   existing approaches in this field have not been adopted widely to date
   due to the extensive use of WSN resources or lack of generality. In this
   article, we therefore consider WSN programming models and runtime
   reconfiguration models as two interrelated factors and we present an
   integrated approach for addressing efficient reprogramming in WSNs. The
   middleware solution we propose, REMOWARE, is characterized by mitigating
   the cost of post-deployment software updates on sensor nodes via the
   notion of in situ reconfigurability and providing a component-based
   programming abstraction in order to facilitate the development of
   dynamic WSN applications. Our evaluation results show that REMOWARE
   imposes a very low energy overhead in code distribution and component
   reconfiguration and consumes approximately 6\% of the total code memory
   on a TELOSB sensor platform.}},

Abstract = {{The judgment of global production networks is facing three major
   challenges. The complexity, measurable through the huge solution space,
   as well as the time-consuming preparation of a decision in line with the
   limited amount of time of the final decision makers - CEOs and upper
   management. The experience from several industry projects showed the
   demand to transfer and apply the concept of gamification in a
   cyber-physical environment to decision-making in Global Footprint
   Design. Smart IT tools, which support the intuition and practical
   knowledge of the decision maker but do not finally make the decision for
   them, are needed. Based on general criteria for successful gamified IT
   tools three specific requirements for judging global production networks
   are derived: value creation, ludic goal orientation and autonomous
   discovery. The major challenges and these specified principles of
   gamification are addressed within the scope of an IT tool which
   simplifies and improves complex global footprint decisions by employing
   elements of gamification. It is analysed to which degree the criteria
   are already fulfilled, which benefits this prototype of a gamified IT
   tool can offer and what future research has to be conducted in order to
   fully let CEOs game their global footprint strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) allows physical objects to be connected on
   the Internet. Objects in the IoT have identities, attributes and
   personalities in the virtual world. These objects are integrated
   together using intelligent interfaces. The IoT has a lot of challenges
   and issues that require further research before achieving a global
   scale. This paper presents a generic IoT architecture to modularize
   physical objects into the digital world. It demonstrates that the future
   IoT can be designed based on component-based communication and existing
   communication standards. To achieve integration both on a device and
   semantic level, physical objects and services can be virtualised as
   instantiated middleware components. By building ontologies,
   third-parties can also customize objects and services.}},

Abstract = {{ThetextitService Component Architecture (SCA) is a
   technology-independent standard for developing distributed
   Service-oriented Architectures (SOA). The SCA standard promotes the use
   of components and architecture descriptors, and mostly covers the
   lifecycle steps of implementation and deployment. Unfortunately, SCA
   does not address the governance of SCA applications and provides no
   support for the maintenance of deployed components. This article covers
   this issue and introduces the FRASCATI platform, a run-time support for
   SCA with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities and run-time management
   features. This article presents the internal component-based
   architecture of the FRASCATI platform, and highlights its key features.
   The component-based design of the FRASCATI platform introduces many
   degrees of flexibility and configurability in the platform itself and it
   can host the SOA applications. This article reports on micro-benchmarks
   highlighting that run-time manageability in the FRASCATI platform does
   not decrease its performance when compared with the de facto reference
   SCA implementation: Apache TUSCANY. Finally, a smart home scenario
   illustrates the extension capabilities and the various reconfigurations
   of the FRASCATI platform. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As wireless sensor networks mature, it becomes clear that the raw data
   collected by this technology can only be used in a meaningful way if it
   can be analyzed automatically. Describing the behavior of the data with
   a model, and then looking at the parameters of the model, or detecting
   differences between the model and the real data, is how experimental
   data is typically used in other fields. The work presented here aims at
   facilitating the use of sensor data models to describe the expected
   behavior of the sensor observations. The processing of such models can
   be pushed into the wireless sensor network to eliminate redundant
   information as early in the data collection chain as possible, thus
   minimizing both bandwidth requirements and energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary computing infrastructure, such as networking stacks, OS and
   middleware, are made up of layers of software functionality that have
   evolved over decades to support the broadest range of applications. The
   feature-richness and the layers of functionality, however, tend to be
   excessive and a source of performance overhead for Cyber-physical
   Systems (CPS). Yet it is necessary to leverage the decades of proven
   patterns and principles in these infrastructures. This paper presents an
   approach to systematically specialize general-purpose middleware used to
   host CPS. Our approach is based on the principles of Feature-Oriented
   Software Development (FOSD), which requires deducing an algebraic
   structure of contemporary middleware based on a higher level of
   abstraction of features. The paper showcase how Origami matrices and
   generative programming can play a key role in realizing the
   specializations. The paper concludes by delving in to future open areas
   of middleware specialization research.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network (WSN) applications sense events in-situ and
   compute results in-network. Their software components should run on
   platforms with stringent constraints on node resources. Developers often
   design their programs by trial-and-error with a view to meeting these
   constraints. Through numerous iterations, they manually measure and
   estimate how far the programs cannot fulfill the requirements, and make
   adjustments accordingly. Such manual process is time-consuming and
   error-prone. Automated support is necessary.
   Based on an existing task view that treats a WSN application as tasks
   and models resources as constraints, we propose a new component view
   that associates components with code optimization techniques and
   constraints. We develop algorithms to synthesize components running on
   nodes, fulfilling the constraints, and thus optimizing their quality. We
   evaluate our proposal by a simulation study adapted from a real-life WSN
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Research in embedded networked sensing has primarily focused on the
   design of hardware architectures for sensor nodes and infrastructure
   protocols for long lived operation of resource constrained sensor
   network deployments. There is now an increasing interest in the
   programming aspects of sensor networks, especially in the broader
   context of pervasive computing. This paper provides a brief overview of
   ongoing research in programming of sensor networks and classifies it
   into layers of abstraction that provide the application developer with
   progressively higher level primitives to express distributed,
   phenomenon-centric collaborative computation, As a specific instance of
   a macroprogramming methodology, we discuss the data driven Abstract Task
   Graph (ATaG) model and the structure of its underlying runtime system.
   ATaG separates the application functionality from non-functional
   aspects, thereby enabling end-to-end architecture-independent
   programming and automatic software synthesis for a class of networked
   sensor systems. A prototype visual programming, software synthesis,
   functional simulation and visualization environment for ATaG has been
   implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing miniaturization and cost reduction in the sector of
   electronic hardware has created ample opportunity for equipping private
   households with inexpensive smart devices for controlling and automating
   various tasks in our daily lives. Networking technology and standards
   have an important role in driving this development. The omnipresence of
   the Internet via phone lines, TV cable, power lines, and wireless
   channels facilitates ubiquitous networks of smart devices that will
   significantly change the way we interact with home appliances. Home
   networking is foreseen to become one of the fastest growing markets in
   the area of information technology. However, interoperability and
   flexibility of embedded devices are key challenges for making smart home
   technology accessible to a broad audience. In particular, the software
   programs that determine the behavior of the smart home must facilitate
   customizability and extensibility. Unlike industrial applications,
   typically engineered by highly skilled programmers, control and
   automation programs for the smart home should be understandable by
   laypeople. In this article we discuss how recent technological progress
   in the areas of visual programming languages, component software, and
   connection-based programming can be applied to programming the smart
   home. As an example of an industrial prototype solution, we present
   microCommander, a visual tool for rapidly programming synergetic devices
   for the smart home.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss our approach to constructing a dynamic and
   secure ``Smart Home{''} environment and tackling the challenges
   associated with it We envision a Smart Home as an active environment
   populated with smart, dynamically configurable consumer devices capable
   of interacting with humans and other smart devices. In such a dynamic
   and active environment, there is a great need for an agile, lightweight,
   distributed security mechanism. This security mechanism needs to be
   programmable and able to evolve as rapidly as the environment itself
   Yet, this mechanism should be able to adapt to environments with scarce
   resources. We present Tiny SESAME to meet these challenges while
   utilizing Jini(TM) technology from Sun Microsystems to handle the common
   parts of distributed devices. Tiny SESAME is a lightweight,
   component-based, Java-implementation of a subset of SESAME. SESAME is an
   extension to Kerberos that supports public key technologies, access
   control, and delegation of access rights. We discuss our Tiny SESAME and
   how it could be integrated with handheld and consumer devices.}},
